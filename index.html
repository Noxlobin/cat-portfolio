        <div>
            <h3>Kitten VS Sheep</h3>
            <p>A kitten just entered the <span class="bold-n-big">ANIMAL PUBLIC JUNIOR SCHOOL</span> by her mom! But unlike cat schools, this was filled with all sorts of animals. Dogs, giraffes, even the blue whale! In an attempt to win, the little kitty decided to fight a sheep! Yes, she was fighting a strong, big sheep with tiny cat muscles! Will she overthrow the sheep in order to be the school champion? Or will she be uncool forever? Find out!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Kitten Documentary</h3>
            <p>A spicy little kitten's story with her beloved parents and how she is the champion of the world! His brothers are <span class="em">too </span>cute.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Hungry Kitten</h3>
            <p>A kitten got really angry today! She did not get to eat chicken today. SHE WANTS FOOD! SHE WANTS FOOD! She destroyed the colony because of her outrage. Meows flood the entire city. It's almost to the point she wants salad (ew). Let's see what happens to the little kitten (hopefully nothing bad).</p>
